# SBIT Sandbox AWS ECS

## OVERVIEW

This is a "quick & dirty" project (2 hours of work...) to deploy an ECS cluster able to support multiple services. It's meant as a proof of concept.

One of the main objectives, using the bespoke modules, is to follow the best practices in the community whilst escaping the complexity of "all able" modules.

## MODULE ARCHITECTURE

The modules are self-contained, building all requirements for their purposes but completely agnostic to the rest of the project and fully portable.

## REPOSITORY STATUS

The present scripts are "incomplete" and "untested" but should work as a guide to the final implementation.

The scripts were exctracted from another project and are not yet fully adapted to the present one.
